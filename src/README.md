___
### How to use:

Note: This plugin requires two instances of minecraft open. One that is your alt account, and another that is the account that needs rescuing.

1. Enable the module on your alt's instance of minecraft. Change the username field to be the username of the player you want to rescue. Case does not matter. 
2. With your alt, log in and target the trapdoor of the pearl stasis chamber. It should light up with a green box after you hover your crosshair over it.
3. With your primary account, log in. Your alt should automatically interact with the trapdoor, pulling the pearl. 
4. Enjoy not having been exploded and take a deep breath to calm your nerves.
___
When you hover over the trapdoor, it should have a box rendered on it if the module is on. If the box is red, that means there is no pearl under the trapdoor, and if the box is blue, that means the trapdoor is closed. 

If the box is green, then it should be good to go and you can log in with your main account.
